# Tutorial on How to do a Dark Matter Analysis with Gammapy starting at DL3

This was originally made for the MAGIC F2F Meeting 2024. 
The goal is to basically make a rough guide on how to perfom an analysis starting from DL3 data and producing Upper Limit plots if no signal is found (which is assumed here by default).

## **1. Caveat: The resulting Upper Limits plots assume an arbitrary J-Factor. This notebook does only include results with no physical meaning ❗**
## **2. Caveat: This notebook only works on this PR https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/5097❗**
